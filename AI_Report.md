# AI Report — Streaming Dashboard Clone

## 1. Overview
This project was developed using modern frontend tools such as Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.  
As per the assignment requirement, AI-assisted coding methods were used to speed up development, reduce boilerplate work, and ensure consistent component structure.

This document explains **where AI assistance was involved** and **how it contributed to the workflow**, without revealing any internal tool names or prompts.

## 2. Areas Where AI Assistance Was Used

### **Project Setup**
AI assistance was used to:
- Generate the initial project folder structure.
- Produce base configurations for Tailwind CSS and PostCSS.
- Suggest TypeScript-safe patterns for organizing server components and shared utilities.

### **TypeScript Interfaces**
AI helped generate strongly typed interfaces for:
- Movie data model
- TMDB list responses
- Common re-usable type definitions

### **API Integration**
AI assisted in:
- Writing reusable API functions for TMDB integration  
- Creating fetch wrappers with error handling  
- Structuring server-only utilities for secure API key usage  

### **Component Generation**
AI contributed to the initial structure and layout of:
- `Header` component  
- `HeroBanner` component  
- `MovieCard` component  
- `MovieRow` component  
- Dynamic detail page: `app/movie/[id]/page.tsx`

These components were later reviewed and refined manually.

### **UI & Layout Suggestions**
AI provided suggestions for:
- Responsive spacing  
- Tailwind utility classes  
- Image optimization best practices (`Image` component)  
- Layout hierarchy and accessibility considerations  

### **Documentation**
AI assistance was used to draft:
- README content structure  
- This AI usage report  

All documentation was reviewed and adjusted to fit the assignment requirements.

## 3. AI Usage Summary

- AI was used to **accelerate repetitive coding parts**, especially boilerplate React/Next.js components.  
- AI helped with **initial drafts**, which were then manually corrected, refined, and tested locally.  
- No proprietary or sensitive information was exposed to any AI system.  
- Final code, logic, and testing were performed manually to ensure correctness.
